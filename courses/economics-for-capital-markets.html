After having learned about Central Banks, we will go back to economic indicators and give examples of some of the more important ones to be familiar with, such as: Gross Domestic Product (GDP), Consumer Price Index (CPI), Purchasing Managers&rsquo; Index (PMI), and Building Permits. Finally, we will end the course by discussing the impact on markets and how the markets should react to economic news vs. how they react in real life.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/thinkific/file_uploads/4670/images/fa0/004/9a5/Screen_Shot_2020-03-26_at_12.40.15_PM.jpg" style="width: auto; max-width: 100%; height: auto;" class="fr-fic fr-dib"></p></div><div class="fr-view"><p><br></p><h3>Economics Course for Capital Markets Learning Objectives</h3><p>Upon completing this course, you will be able to:</p><ul><li>Know how economic principles impact financial markets.</li><li>Classify &amp; interpret economic releases.</li><li>Understand Central Banks, their goals, and role in the economy.</li><li>Perceive how specific markets are impacted by specific economic events.</li><li>Grasp how market practitioners use this information to trade and invest.</li></ul><p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/thinkific/file_uploads/4670/images/c8f/357/92d/Screen_Shot_2020-03-26_at_12.16.44_PM.jpg" style="width: auto; max-width: 100%; height: auto;" class="fr-fic fr-dib"></p><p><br></p><h3><br>Economics Course for Capital Markets is a Prerequisite of CFI&rsquo;s CMSA&trade; Program</h3><p>CFI&rsquo;s upcoming Capital Markets &amp; Securities Analysis (CMSA)&trade; program will cover all the basic, intermediate, and advanced topics about sales and trading, investment banking, and asset management.

                        The course gave me great insight and knowledge on types of economic releases, how the financial market reacts to economic releases and how various market players trade on these economic releases to mention a few.

                        In this "Economics for Capital Markets" course, you learn a lot (an awful lot) about Central Banks, etc. And, you'll learn fascinating words such as "fastidiously", a word that I have never encountered even in the entire CFA L1 curriculum. Strongly recommend inserting toothpicks on outside of eyelids to keep them open and placing pillows around you on the floor just in case you pass out from utter boredom. This course is about as exciting as my first marriage... or watching a freshly painted fence dry. Good thing it eventually ends and you can move on to the next course which is much more fun. Enjoy! :)
