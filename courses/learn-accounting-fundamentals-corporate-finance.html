I understand why but I think you probably need to make people aware of these terms for future use.\r\n\r\n-  In Interactive Exercise 5 you reference 31 November but there's only 30 days in November.\r\n\r\n-  I would tweak your explanation of accruals a little as it should be referenced as \"expenses incurred where you have not yet received the invoice for them yet\"\r\n\r\n-  Perhaps you should also consider explaining the concepts of 'accrued revenue' and 'deferred revenue' too.\r\n\r\n-  In the section on \"depreciation and the three financial statements\" shouldn't you have referenced the reduction in cash in the balance sheet as well as in the cash flow statement?\r\n\r\n-  In the balance sheet module, I don't think you introduced the term \"working capital\" which you used in the \"cash flow\" module.\r\n\r\n-  In the period 3 example on the cash flow statement, it sounds like the instructor says the net income is \"170\" rather than \"175\".\r\n\r\n-  In interactive example 10, I would state there is no depreciation recognised for the PP\u0026amp;E line or, better yet, include the depreciation charge and amend the answer.\r\n\r\nHope the above is helpful.

There are many different ways of depreciating non-current or fixed assets, but depending on the laws within your jurisdiction you might have to comply with a specific method. However, skilled accountants who operate internally within a company must be able to do multiple versions. The unit of production method is useful for extrapolating costs beyond the useful life of just any single asset and can be used to concatenate the expected costs of replenishing a specific type of asset; to analyze the potential impact (positive or negative) of adopting different technologies in the foreseeable future. If some assets undergo additions, impairment, damage, repairs or maintenance, those costs alongside depreciation might make a person look differently at the financing picture as a whole. It all comes together, and it's important to consider ahead of the day-to-day operating how long-term financing and investing decisions can lower operating costs and boost production quality.","name":"Level of Insight","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","bestRating":5,"ratingValue":5,"worstRating":0}},{"@type":"Review","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Christopher Pellicano"},"description":"Would have to have taken countless amounts of dollars worth of \"filler\" courses to justify nothing in the end.

Creating an account and getting signed up is disturbing to say the least.   I took a screenshot and showed it to a computer person and they agreed it was backwards.  I think someone needs to go through the motions and see what the problem is which leads me to wonder why someone hasn't even tested this out.  The content and videos so far are pretty good, however once a slide or module is done, you can't go back and watch it again.  If you want to rewind, then it goes too fast and takes you to the next screen where you find out that you cannot go back in and review it again.  Again, someone programmed this and never went thru the program as in program testing.  Obviously this is my perception based on my experience so far.  After 20 years of not doing much accounting, I am going thru the prerequisite now.  I have had some questions so far, but who do you reach out to.  If there is someone, then are these people really have the time to answer tons of questions not only coming from me but others.  I'm actually going to have to pull out reading 22 of the CFA curriculum to brush up on accounting as this appears to provide more content than a rough sketch of what I am experiencing.  Again, I'm only in the beginning stage of this.  It may turn out that I did enjoy this program.  Right now, I'm 50/50 on whether I made an informed decision with this purchase.

                        I've never completed a course like this before (remote instruction) and I cannot express how great the instructor was and the overall content of the material. I would defintely recommend this to my co-workers as well as friends. I will be looking into taking more of these courses through  this platform in the near future. Thank you!"

                        Finally got a clear view of how the 3 financial statements are related. The best course I've attended, even counting the basic finance I took in my university BBA as well as 2 finance for non-financial mgr courses later in my job.
Provides an immediate overview that helps me see how they are interlinked and related.
The practice exercises are also very helpful and practical.

                        The Accounting Fundamental was an excellent refresher for us who had done accounting before. The summaries in all areas of the financial statements( Income Statement, Balance Sheet and Cashflow Statements) were spot on in every example and explanation. Great delivery.

                        The course is very informative, i have been hearing the terms like PP&amp;E wondering what are those,but after enrolling in this course i have learnt and understood the basic and most important information to aid me in my daily operational job and more willing to pursue Accounting as a profession, it's been insightful.  Easy to relate to now that am working on Finance and admin department, am very excited and feel more confident, being that i have never been in a Finance class or even admin. I am an IT Profession. I recommend this course to anyone thinking Accounting is difficult. It is NOT.

                        I am from an Engineering and Science background with little or no knowledge of accountancy. Thus, I was a little skeptical before taking this course, wondering if I would be able to understand, let alone, appreciate the content. My accountant wife encouraged me to give it a go and I am glad that I did! The content was simple, well-explained and examples were provided to ensure that the concepts were understood.
I would highly recommended this course to anyone with an interest in the fundamentals of accounting!

                        I just completed the Financial Accounting Course and it was properly scripted and lectured. I truly enjoyed the breakdown of the modules, exercises and the assessment.

As an amateur in Financial Accounting, this course was just perfect, plus I also have a pdf for futuristic purposes.

                        I found CFI as the best online program for career builders. 
The courses of the program are well structured and understandable. 
A big thank you to Tim Vipond for the immense explanation through the video. 
I'm so going to recommend this program to friends so as to be a partaker.

                        This is not a debits and credits courses.  Its a structural explanation of the operations of the financial statements in a short, but fair complex manner. Its simple and straight forward enough to understand with some critical thinking, but no too hard to need an accounting degree to pass.  If you are in the financial field, spend a short weekend are review with the course.  Nothing to loose, everything to gain.

                        The method and presentation used are very helpful in picturing the transactions to help understand exactly what is being done, where and why when recording a transaction using accounting rules.

The template used to record each transaction or journal entry on the template having Balance Sheets 3 major sections or components namely - Assets split into current assets and non current assets and on the other side Liabilities split further into current liabilities and non current liabilities and finally Net Worth or Equity which also records the income statement entries, was fantastic and helps get a clearer picture of where each transaction effects and the impact of the same.

The numerous excel templates with exercise and ready solutions to compare our working helps understand if we have correctly understood the concepts and are able to implement our learning correctly. If the exercise were not made available, then the learning would not be so effective.

The pace is just right and the content is rich and appropriate and tests adequate to complete the learning experience, helping to build confidence.

                        I do like the explanations, they were very clear, but i would love that the term "balance sheet" be changed to statement of financial position and other accounting terms to what they are being currently referred to as. Thank so much, this really helped me to refresh my memory.

                        This course introduced me to the calculation of cash flow using both the direct and indirect methods. I also learnt how to develop, from scratch, cash flow statement through the use of previous and current balance sheets as well as income statement. The course also deepened my knowledge of depreciation. It certainly worth my time, besides I need the knowledge as I recently secured a job as a relationship officer in a bank.

                        Hi,

I thought the overall course was good but had the following feedback:

-  You don't mention the terms "debit" or "credit" which is pretty fundamental to accounting.  I understand why but I think you probably need to make people aware of these terms for future use.

-  In Interactive Exercise 5 you reference 31 November but there's only 30 days in November.

-  I would tweak your explanation of accruals a little as it should be referenced as "expenses incurred where you have not yet received the invoice for them yet"

-  Perhaps you should also consider explaining the concepts of 'accrued revenue' and 'deferred revenue' too.

-  In the section on "depreciation and the three financial statements" shouldn't you have referenced the reduction in cash in the balance sheet as well as in the cash flow statement?

-  In the balance sheet module, I don't think you introduced the term "working capital" which you used in the "cash flow" module.

-  In the period 3 example on the cash flow statement, it sounds like the instructor says the net income is "170" rather than "175".

-  In interactive example 10, I would state there is no depreciation recognised for the PP&amp;E line or, better yet, include the depreciation charge and amend the answer.

Hope the above is helpful.  I thought the overall course was an excellent intro to accounting.

                        The topics discussed under Accounting Fundamentals have refreshed the knowledge I acquired during my Undergraduate studies. The objectives learned have set me ready to study other fundamental, core and skill topics under the guidance of Corporate Finance Institute. I am therefore overly satisfied with the contents of this course.

                        As a 16-year-old kid who wants to learn finance this really helped out since there is no finance course in my school and we cant learn finance in schools until we´re like 20-21 where I live. As a beginner, I felt this was explained very well and I passed! Well with 3 takes of the assessment, but I did pass and that´s what really matters.

                        This course is actually quite good. The details behind debits and credits and coverage of the three key financial statements (Balance Sheet, Income Statement, and Cash Flow Statement) are quite good. Picked up a few great pointers in the practice exercises, which are downloadable spreadsheets with answers. Definitely recommend.

                        This course is very complete and it cleared little gaps that I had when I studied financial statements for the first time. I loved the course! Nice job. I only have one recommendation, the statement of changes in equity was missing, however, I don't know if in practice this statement is very useful for financial valuation and planning for the future. Nonetheless, good course, hope the others are as cool as this one.

                        The examples and  explanation in this course are quite simple. I feel like I'm starting to understand the material and am building my confidence on the topic.

Then they ask you questions to test your knowledge. Do you know how frustrating it is to go through a course, understand everything because it's relatively simple and then be asked questions on things you haven't been taught? Am I able to understand the basic examples they give me? Yes. Can I answer the more difficult real world questions in excel that they ask me, based on what I've been taught, not even close.

                        it is really helpful for students in Universities, especially for self-studied students. Dividing small units. So, it is easy to follow. 
However, the amount of knowledge is too narrow for people who are working and want to study more, in my opinion. 
anyway, thanks a lot

The pdf files that are provided for download and review also mention an online exercise, however, there are no links provided to them.

                        The course is very very excellent
It is already comprehensive for financial statements (balance sheet), income statement and cash flow statement
It included the effect of accounting operations on the financial statements
Also, I could not find better modeling of financial reports in this smooth way
I thank the authors of this excellent work for the best global way

                        This course provides the basics to get your foot through the door allowing for any new learners to get a feel for this whole course and the direction of where accounting would be heading. However, there isn't enough concept retained properly through the workload so any new learners would fail to retain the knowledge. But, overall it helps you get started really well especially with the free costs.

                        I wanted to give 5 stars but there was a problem with multimedia questions. In question no. 10 part 1 I gave all answers correctly but the message shows my answers are incorrect. I tried second time as well but the message remained the same thus my score was lowered to 50% otherwise the course is ok and suitable for beginners.

                        The income statement section was very poorly done, did not feel equipped to take on the exercises at all. The intuition was not developed on how to record the debit and credit side transactions. Improvement is needed.

                        This course was great.  It really was a good refresher on the balance sheet, income statement and cashflow statement.  The examples and exercises were well structured and re-enforced the learning objective.  The exercises building the cash flow statement from scratch were excellent. If I could make a suggestion to make this course even better, it would be more exercises to practice that gradually built on complexity.

                        Before finding this institute, I had no idea where I would start without paying student loans( which I can NOT afford right now). When I came across CFI, i couldnt have been more pleased with just the Accounting Fundamental Certificate i received a pay raise immediately along with a promotion. Now that i know how and what to look for, the company did not mind paying me for it. WIN -WIN I can t wait to complete all the free courses and then im on to get my FMVA Certificate by New Years 2020. Its part of my vision and CFI is how I will get there!!
Thank You CFI my family and I really appreciate these courses and the start I need to follow my dreams!

                        My biggest complaint so far is the programming.  Creating an account and getting signed up is disturbing to say the least.   I took a screenshot and showed it to a computer person and they agreed it was backwards.  I think someone needs to go through the motions and see what the problem is which leads me to wonder why someone hasn't even tested this out.  The content and videos so far are pretty good, however once a slide or module is done, you can't go back and watch it again.  If you want to rewind, then it goes too fast and takes you to the next screen where you find out that you cannot go back in and review it again.  Again, someone programmed this and never went thru the program as in program testing.  Obviously this is my perception based on my experience so far.  After 20 years of not doing much accounting, I am going thru the prerequisite now.  I have had some questions so far, but who do you reach out to.  If there is someone, then are these people really have the time to answer tons of questions not only coming from me but others.  I'm actually going to have to pull out reading 22 of the CFA curriculum to brush up on accounting as this appears to provide more content than a rough sketch of what I am experiencing.  Again, I'm only in the beginning stage of this.  It may turn out that I did enjoy this program.  Right now, I'm 50/50 on whether I made an informed decision with this purchase.

                        It was annoying that I had to keep clicking "Next" every 30-60 seconds because this was how long the average video was. Instead, these videos should have been longer to retain our attention and provide more convenience.

However, the concepts and knowledge provided in this course is good and detailed.

                        I found this course when I really needed it. I am a young and fresh entrepreneur with no formal business training. I needed to know how to compose a Balance Sheet, Income Statement and Cash Flow statement.

I learnt so much in so little time. I really love how this powerful information has been packaged. Anyone can do this course, no matter how busy or time tight.
Simply the best.

                        Thank you so much CFI team for this free course... I am not from finance background but due to my interest in value investing I had always wanted to learn to read balance sheets and financial statements... Thanks so much for your valuable effort and help...
Just want to add this though that beginners like myself would be better off had we been also introduced or given some ideas about the differences between a standalone and  consolidated balance sheets... Anyway I really appreciate your course... It's clear and to the point👍👍👍

                        I am basically a hardcore R&amp;D professional with 19+ years of experience in the automotive background. I hold masters in mechanical engineering and post-graduation in operations management from a reputed institution(CEG, Anna University, and IIM -K).

I personally want to thank the tutor who prepared the material and the way he presented it. I would say one of the best courses, which I took online.

The material is very focused on the topics and excellent quiz. It will be even useful for those who are in the same field but want to brush up their subject quickly.

all the courses provided by CFI are best to my knowledge

Thx,
Sathya

                        Would have to have taken countless amounts of dollars worth of "filler" courses to justify nothing in the end. CFI brought home better value, more efficient use of my money in one wrap up course and I actually learned "something useful" and benefited from this course more than UTEP or EPCC or any where else online. Elated I found CFI as my career option to transition into finance and accounting.

                        As I have myself attained plenty of working experience at a tax accounting firm and I find these fundamentals to accurately reflect the accounting insights needed to interpret and use financial statements. There are many different ways of depreciating non-current or fixed assets, but depending on the laws within your jurisdiction you might have to comply with a specific method. However, skilled accountants who operate internally within a company must be able to do multiple versions. The unit of production method is useful for extrapolating costs beyond the useful life of just any single asset and can be used to concatenate the expected costs of replenishing a specific type of asset; to analyze the potential impact (positive or negative) of adopting different technologies in the foreseeable future. If some assets undergo additions, impairment, damage, repairs or maintenance, those costs alongside depreciation might make a person look differently at the financing picture as a whole. It all comes together, and it's important to consider ahead of the day-to-day operating how long-term financing and investing decisions can lower operating costs and boost production quality.

                        Even though I work in A/R every day and have regular exposure to certain aspects of the key financial documents outlined in this course, CFI has brought my understanding of each - and, more importantly, of their relationships to one another - to a whole new level. Of all of the online accounting refresher courses I have taken, this one stands out as the very best. Right from the beginning, the videos and animated slides are engaging and interesting. The narrator has real personality and speaks with clarity about each of the topics addressed. And the assessments are thought provoking and relevant. I expected to learn a few things but did not expect to have as much fun and to learn quite as much as I did. Thank you to all at CFI who put this awesome course together!

                        If someone made a course on finance with metaphors that related to things outside of finance so that people could actually connect the dots and understand, they would be making millions and millions of dollars. It's a good course for sure, BUT extremely dry like everything else out there which means it's hard to learn from.

Going to look for something less dry :/

                        This exercise is not particularly well done compared to the others in that the excel spreadsheet to fill out (and the corresponding solution) are not consistent in either presentation (i.e. debits on the left column, credits on the right column) or follow accounting conventions (debit amounts are positive and credit amounts are negative). I would recommend updating the exercise and the solution so that the flow is clearer with possibly splitting income statement accounts from balance sheet accounts for presentation purposes.

                        i am very familiar with cash flow statements.  in doing the excel practices, however, i found it very confusing to put a plus and minus sign in front of AR and AP...it unnecessarily colors the calculations.  if an AR is a source of cash or a use of cash, then let the calculation stand.  by placing a - or + in the adjacent cell it causes me to sometimes change a positive to a negative and vice versa.

                        The material was excellent, also the way that the concepts were explained, far from the mechanics, focus on explaining the logical, and the bonds between the financial statements.

It was amazing!!

                        To be honest I like the way CFI conducted the accounting fundamentals in few organised parts and sections which is far more efficient and better than how i learn in my uni lecturer. The content is absolutely relevant, detailed, simple and clearly represented to students who are still new in accounting course. I do think that CFI has perfectly tailored the students need with its learning objectives as well as learning content. Thank you very much.
*P/S: TBH I have better learning experience here compare to my uni lecturer XD

                        Its the best decision I ever made in a very long time. I a studying this course alongside my MBA-Finance program. I can seem to have enough of it! The material is so easy to understand and digest. I wish I  had known about Cgi earlier. True value for money. Thanks CFI.

                        I obtained accounting degree five years back, going through Accounting Fundamentals was great. What I appreciate most is that, the course materials are sufficient, free and top quality. I did know there are Professional Accounting Institute that offer free quality courses until I visited CFI website. God bless you.

                        Overall, this is an informative course to build basic knowledge in accounting. Besides, it contains practical examples and exercises.
It would be better if the course has a discussion board where learners could ask questions or discuss with other learners and instructors. The assessment test should be more difficult and contain more practical rather than theoretical exercises.

                        That is so poor!!!!!!!! 
Looks like a joke. I went through 5 different online accounting courses and you got nothing here. It's more like precourse not a course. 
Nobody would be able to do anything in accounting after that course. The only what you should do after that is to take serious course.
I recommend to take look at a courses like principlesofaccounting.com. Its very general but they have 1000 times more than you guys. Even on you tube you can find a lot of good staff.
As my advise think about processing at least about 500 journal entries during entire (beginning) course. With explanations of all the problems, of course.

                        This was a great course for me to take in order to get full understanding of the Financial statements used in a business. I really enjoyed the videos, especially how detailed they were for each function of the financial statements. I would recommend this course to anyone looking to refresh what they may have learned in college.

                        Hi Sir,

Thank you for this wonderful course, it helped me a lot,since i am in Accounting Dept, and there's some words which i hear but didn't know what it meant and now i can put my head up high and say " i know what it means".
So Thank you so much.

                        I don't understand. The Excel files for Luton, Inc are nowhere near what was covered in the lesson. I believe they meant 500 and not 5,000 in the solution as well. There is no formula to show how they arrived at their numbers.

                        Overall course content and exercise materials are very well structured and presented so that it is very easy to follow through. The short quizzes are concisely constructed.

A suggestion to make it even better would be that they are expanded to provide a more in-depth evaluation on the mastery of the course content and objectives with the questions designed to cover more alternative situations, considerations or assumptions to be taken into account in making the correct answer choices.

And just a note on the course notes document, there are 2 duplicates slides (page 39 &amp; 40) with exactly the same content starting with the title "The Cash Flow Statement: Cash Before Financing" on those slides.

                        Great information, but the quizzes and problem sets are frustrating. If I get an answer wrong, I don't have an explanation as to why- that takes away from the learning experience. It would be helpful to provide video solutions to fully understand what is going on. Also, the videos close right after they finish and don't allow you to internalize the information without having to reopen the video.

P.S I couldn't give 5 * ratings as my browser was acting up :(

                        This course stimulated my interest in learning more about accounting. I learned a lot and it is very easy to understand and follow. After doing all the exercises, I am pretty confident that my accounting proficiency increased. Thank you very much. You are the best. I hope you give more free courses and certificates.

                        I have an MBA and I am currently working on an MS in Finance, and I am very happy to say that the skills I learned from this accounting course not only solidified my current understanding of the material, but it also enhanced and added to my current knowledge. There are hands-on exercises via Excel as well as exams that you must pass to earn your accredited certificate--a certificate that CFI will back up for employers. The certificate is also worth credit from multiple institutions, such as the CFA to name one. I'm happy. This product is worth much more than what I paid, too. Excellent work CFI!

                        This course is a great introduction to the 3 Financial Statements. 
The course easily extends from the basic concepts of the 3 financial statements into working examples. The course wraps up with you having a working knowledge of what aspect of financial accounting each financial statement addresses. What I found very useful was how the course relates the Balance Sheet to the Income Statement. The second half of the course then illustrates -- with many intuitive demonstrations --, how the more complex Cashflow Statement is derived from the first two financial statements.
I found the delivery of the course, with its short videos and extensive illustrations, made learning sessions very light and easy.
The course notes that are in the process of being supplied with each course, makes for very handy review sessions.
After undertaking the accounting fundamentals, I purchased the full suite of Corporate Finance, and find the various courses fascinating. I thought this course matter would be too opaque to a newbie, but am experiencing it to be very learnable in its succinct short videos format. 5 stars
