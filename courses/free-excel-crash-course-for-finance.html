Of course I would think so since I am not a Excel super user. The best part was learning the short cuts. Some are a bit cumbersome but  well worth learning.

One down side for me  with the course is that I would have liked to see how Tim would teach v lookup and pivot tables. Tim has the ability to not stumble over his words, is a clear speaker and never tires no matter how many times I hit the rewind button. :) Great job!

                        I think the course was very informative and very well curated by the instructor, but I did feel there should have been more formulas to be discusses for example, NPV or IRR. Other than that it's a very nice course.

                        Even if you are expert in Microsoft Excel, you should join this course which let us know about the basic and advanced techniques in wholly different way. The color coding, shortcuts, power functions, i'll say that i really enjoyed the course.

                        This excel course is good , it can be learned by those who know  a little bit but this course does not make sense of everything because it is a crash course. commerce students and those who want to know financial analysis can do this course.

                        The Course for me was so engaging and  the instructor took it from the scratch, which makes it easy for anyone to meet up and for those who already had the knowledge it was like a refresher course .Also, i would like to add that this course was so insightful, especially the short cuts.Thank You CFI for sharing .

                        I found this course to be very interactive, and very well explained. SInce the Instructor was explaining and at the same time demonstrating it with a Spread sheet,  it was very easy to comprehend and also follow the demo by doing it along by myself. 

This is a MUST course for anyone who uses Excel for anything more than as a calculator.

                        Excellent presentation. One interactive exercise "may" have a included a question that was covered later on in the course (possibly exercise 3 or 4). 
Beginners would have to pay closer attention as the narrator does not always narrate what is being done in detail if it includes a step that was previously explained in another instance.

                        I found this course very useful and I found that the short cuts are immensely helpful and also I came to know more functions and how to use them.

Especially the way to use them as a part of a profitability statement was a great tactic of teaching.

                        The Excel crash course has opened my mind to a better way of using excel and how to design my excel worksheet in a better way.
Thanks to CFI TEAM they have made an easy to understand course using examples covering most of MS Excel (shortcuts ,formulas , worksheet design ,...) , I have learned from the course and noticed how excel is easy and powerful tool for building dynamic analysis worksheets.
I recommend the course for every one who works in the accounting/finance or needs to use MS EXCEL.

                        I will strongly recommend this course (Excel Crash Course) to other individual who require additional excel skills with limited time availability.  The course was well organized, clear and easy to follow and the instructor (Tim Vipond) was very knowledgeable with excellent presentation skills.

                        The content of this course is really helpful, during and after the course to keep on practising. I have learnt a lot of new techniques/ formulas to use in excel. The only suggestion I would like to give complimentary trial access to excel for the ones who cannot afford to buy the MS office subscription in order to practice while learning. The teaching method is very adaptable and easy to understand. Thumbs up to the team, you guys are doing great job. Thanks!!!!!! 🥰🥰.

                        Do not waste your time. The final exam is an endless loop. You will be spending hours trying to figure which question was missed in order to get over the 80% threshold. 
Go on to another CPE.

                        I had tried searching for numerous websites to find the best way to learn excel and especially the financial analysis part. I couldn't imagine that CFI kept was so attached that it kept me too engaging in its videos, interactive exercise, etc. It was a motivating and truly an academic course. I am excited to join other courses at CFI again. Thank You for this platform.

                        Frankly said, im a novice on using Excel but the way this course showed me that it is manageable and how easy to learn it makes me want some more. Mr. Tim Vipond as the instructor really help me as viewer onto understanding points of excel formulas and functions. I really hope I can implemented this in my next job. Thank you very much!

                        I always thought I knew most of the things about excel. But after taking this course, I learned even more. Especially the keyboard shortcuts. Never thought that they would be so helpful &amp; efficient. 
The instructor was very clear and concise about every topic he is teaching. It wasn't difficult for me at all to understand the course materials. I hope this is the same for beginners.

                        I am glad that my hands got on to this course through one of my friends. This is really wonderful if you're a beginner for the excel or if you just want to refurbish your excel skills this is the platform you're looking for. Throughout the session, I was a keen listener this helped we a lot just I would like to point out a few good things about this course,

1) Each topic is nicely sectioned.
2) Reviewing each lecture after the end of session.
3) Highly focused on the corporate analysis aspects.

                        The way this course and its structure is developed and presented, is just awesome. The lectures delivered and the knowledge i was able to gain through them sharpened my financial modelling abilities by using excel. I learned a lot about various shortcut keys, short ways to deal with formulas , functions and the best thing was operating Excel without with a single click i.e. completely using a keyboard, made me realize how much time one can save  by not being dependent on the use of a mouse.  It really is good course and i would like to recommend all others who read my feedback to avail this free of cost opportunity to enhance your skills. 
Thank You, Tim Vipond!

                        I am giving you guys 5 stars because the platform and the way the instructor explains each part of the course are really good and clear. I also enjoy and think that is a really good way of learning that on each session there is at least 1 quiz for us to prove our knowledge. 

I had a really good time learning and you can't say that about all of online courses and classes. You guys are doing a great work.

Thank you!

                        This excel crash course is a very sharp focused to introduce us to the best practices in building a interactive financial model. It covers the majority formulas, best practices, both tips to use Keyboard as well as mouse. 
The instructor (Mr Tim - CEO) takes us through the journey very smoothly and help in building the foundation. The formulas, formatting, examples, resources suggested and the recommended exercise are really very helpful in learning.
The resources shared for this course are highest quality.

Thanks to the entire team CFI for building this course &amp; hats off your efforts, simplicity &amp; quality.

                        I have fully completed the Excel Crash Course provided by CFI. The content is awesome &amp; it clears all the basics of Excel. I was not sure about the toughness of English that will be used, but the English was so simple &amp; easy to understand. I want to thank the CFI for making these course FREE. The content of the course was superb. CFI has won my confidence &amp; i will try to do the FMVA Certification at the earliest.

                        Hi,

I find this course a very well designed course, although I knew every bit of it but I still found it a good refresher. Must for all the beginners, I should add.

Thanks for keeping it free of cost, for everyone.

                        Very insightful and easy to learn course. This course consists of a lot of things that I never knew. It has motivated me to check out all the functionalities of Excel. Also, to all the Finance people out there, this is a must-do course that will not only enhance your knowledge but also sharpen your skills. Kudos to Tim Vipond :)

                        Highly recommend it. I knew this course would be good because of the quality of the free content available on CFI's website and YouTube channel.
CFI overdelivered in terms of content, quality of video &amp; audio recording, structure of the course, interactive exercises that weren't trivial and the online platform itself.
Will definitely pursue more courses and eventually the FMVA Certification.

                        The course is very useful indeed for someone who is unable to join excel and other Microsoft software trainings. It's actually good for leaning oneself and instructions on training videos are clear. I am enjoying all the lessons so far and I am really amazed how fast I am improving by watching and listening to videos. I am just a beginner in excel and after finishing half of those lessons, I feel more confident than ever. Thank you. CFI.

                        I didn't like that the instructor used the keyboard so much in a prerequisite course like this. It was like he wanted to show off his knowledge (with so many shortcuts) rather than to help someone who tries to learn something because it is so hard to assimilate so much information directly  something that makes the whole lesson difficult to understand and inappropriate. Within the course i suppose that the level will be more advanced and we will have all the time to do try more complex things thats why i believe that it would be very helpful to change it

                        I recently completed this course and I have some suggestions to you that might prove valuable, since I have been facing the great use of these formulas when using Excel. 

In the Advance Formula Section of the course [Sum, Average, Sum product, Median]
Data from above the section has been brought down by value paste. You can do this by using Lookup formulas or Index and Match formula since these are not covered anywhere in course, would be of value to new users. 
While the random number are generated on your basis, you could use the RANDOM function and leave it or value paste since these data changes frequently while using Random. 

What you have done is great, I just gave up some ideas where more formulas could be added. 
I hope my suggestions get some valuable feedback and review too.

                        I never thought I will learn this advance formula on modelling, forecasting and especially the keyboard shortcuts, in just a quick time, the content was awesome, the delivery was fantastic, and overall its was worth spending my time here, I learnt more than expected.

                        I like the chapter that you arrange hierocracy and especially I prefer how we use the keyboard rather than the mouse . This thing appeases me Most is the freeze option, which option I need to alter in file option prior to starting excel work, how to calculate weight average and also the voice is so clear. However, sometimes videos show vague . I think authority should think this matter .

                        To whom it may concerns. 

I really enjoyed the course and the content was great and easy to understand and very well structured. 

There was one thing that made the course a bit difficult. As all short cuts introduced as well as all the quizzes and test are related to the English excel version which made it kind of difficult.

I am from Switzerland and I have the Germen Excel version which all the short cuts are different. I am aware of the fact that I am presenting a minority of the students. I just liked to mention that fact.

However, I really enjoyed the course. Best regards Josef

Great for a crash course. The subject is well-paced, the interactive exercises &amp; quizzes keep the student engaged and allow gaining feedback. I would suggest that there are minor tech issues with the functions keys for those in another operating system like Mac users. 

Overall, excellent and comprehensive course.

                        To use Keyboard shortcuts are really useful and fun. The only problem pops up when You have different keyboard than the standard UK, and Your Excel is not English but f.e Hungarian like in my case. To complete a test about shortcuts a bit difficult :) but manageable on logical way.
Anyway to use shortcut was one if the take aways:)

I gave 4*, the course was good refreshing the BASICs.

                        The course was very well delivered and the content is amazing.The only think I would like to add is that it is easier to use 'Ctrl + Alt + V' shortcut of paste special than the one mentioned in the course.
Also,Ctrl + G opens the Go To dialog box on both Mac and PC.

                        So far I love this course.  Its very helpful. However, when attempting to answer the exercise questions, I have the right answers, but it still tells me I'm incorrect. I guess I'm not sure how those little puzzle pieces go together.  There should be some instruction on how to answer the questions.  Only four starss because of the issue with answering the exercise questions.

                        It's such a good program that allow all the candidates can improve their excel skill with good introduction and shortcut key in the excel. It is useful for our tasks with the excel and we can enjoy with many shortcut keys instead of mouse.

Thank for this free online course and I already completed it.

                        Horrible experience if you are a Mac user — the test questions provide silly shortcut keys that have absolutely no value to a mac user. There is no way to go back and find the shortcuts easily. If you are not willing to review the entire course again just to pull out worthless keystrokes you can't pass the exams. I was having a good time until the tests. I was looking forward to additional courses but I will have to say that I got discouraged after searching the internet for an hour to find keyboard shortcuts that have no value. I will come back if I am ever silly enough to buy a windows machine. 

Thanks, 
John

                        This course was done perfectly with step by step videos to follow.
This course would have helped me when I was starting out using Excel at work.
Very thorough and definitely necessary as a prerequisite.
Thank you for the great course I am looking forward to the others.

                        This was a fantastic course. I am so pleased I have learnt so much. The programme is so easy to navigate, and the downloads to follow and learn.
I think it is great, that CFI are encouraging those to learn, who perhaps may not be able to afford expensive courses.
I will absolutely recommend to people. I actually already have.

There are so many programmes to choose from, and another incentive is that if you are not entirely sure which career you want to work towards, these short free courses are a taster, to see if they are suitable for you.

Thank you CFI.

Kind regards

                        Overall very good presentation. 
Towards the end, the lecturer was not explaining formula in detail, so I had to stop the video and look at each cell that comprises the formula. 
But overall, great!

                        Hey guys, thanks for giving this precious info - key usage.
The course is very well structured. I have been looking for something like this for some time :). Ok, maybe a little harder, with more complex If formula and combination of OR and AND, but this is a start.

Again thanks :)

                        Excellent training videos, learnt loads in just a few hours. However, it is quick-paced for those who are less familiar with keyboard shortcuts and I had to pause many times and resort to split-screen on WIN10 to keep up. Also, a few of the values that were entered in were unexplained (i.e the ones without a formula. Why did you choose this number in particular? even if the number choice was random, it would have still been nice to know about it).

Anyway, I'm really glad that I took this course, and I have very few complaints. Will definitely be returning.

P.S: I would critically review this course 4.5/5, but as this isn't an option, I've rounded the stars up, not down, as it was so helpful and free of charge.

                        I'm already proficient at Excel without a mouse, and love for the first time (not kidding) hearing another professional with more experience than I actually say how important it is to be mouse free for overall processing, formatting, calculating and typewriting speed. I've believe that for so long but sadly all the places I have worked people don't encourage that enough. Often, patience is not people's strongsuit but it is so worth it. It took me two years to master touch typing and another year to touch type effectively all the Excel commands. It is so worth it, especially when seeing Excel continuing to expand into newer versions. It is a powerful skillset I have never regretted since acquiring. I did learn quite a few new shortcuts here too. Thank you!

                        Really displeased with this class.
1) Only Microsoft Office 2019 &amp; Office 365 are available for purchase currently
2) Microsoft has announced that they will no longer support Office 2016 in 2020
3) There are not enough Mac prompts to show the Mac keys along with the PC keys popup
4) the PC to Mac excel short cut download does not have the shortcuts that the teacher is using

There should be separate class that goes into how to do the PC to Mac shortcuts so we can follow along with the instructor. Or you all should upgrade to Office 365. There is no point in buying an Excel 2016 or Office 2016 at this point, because Microsoft will no longer support it.

Really disappointed and don't know how to continue with the FMVA program.

                        This course on the excel shortcuts was great, however only for PC. Since the creation of this class MAC has updated and many the discussed shortcuts are now available on MAC as well. I think updating the slides to include MAC shortcut is in order.

                        Hello,

I really liked your course, but maybe you need to know that as the videos were playing, very often the headline screen of the excel video would turn black, so i could not see what the instructor was showing, but could only hear. It was ok, but maybe you could fix it.

Kindest regards,

Nina

                        I am using Mac, so I try and learn all the mac shortcuts presented in this course. It is, however, confusing that you ask in the quizzes to give answers about Windows hotkeys, which are not relevant to me. You could at least in the quizzes write in brackets the corresponding hotkeys to Mac, which shouldn't be too difficult. Also, it is a bit disappointing that you do not indicate some very important Mac shortcuts and only present Windows shortcuts, for instance, locking cell references (F4 for Windows) is Cmd + T on Mac, which I think is one of the most important shortcuts to know.

                        Hi, I used this course to help me get started with the basics of Excel for financial analysis. The sessions were well structured and well-paced. The only issue I faced was the lack of keyboard shortcuts since I use a Mac. I suggest using Windows laptop to get the maximum ROI from this course.

                        My appreciation and gratitude for  this free financial modelling course. It is short but well structured. Emphasizing on the use of short cuts,  key functions , formulars  applied to develop and control the model. Great opportunity to learn and improve your excel modelling skills.
Have a nice day.

                        I would really like to thank CFI for making such a course. For a beginner like me, this course was really helpful and insightful. I really appreciate the time and effort you guys have put. I am very much interested in purchasing the advanced course. However, I am yet to receive the certificate. I hope I receive that soon. Thank you so much!!

                        This is a good place to start if you are feeling rusty with excel. This course taught me everything I needed to really dive directly into the program, it boosted my confidence level tremendously. The instructor was very clear in explaining every concept. I am really looking forward to the next class. I am very excited!

                        The course was great but i would have question the narrator for going TOO fast at times and it was difficult to catch up and I had to restart several times when I lost the plot, so to speak!!

                        As a senior engineer for a large utility company and also currently enrolled in an executive MBA program at a local state institution I am no stranger to MS Excel.  However, this course rejogged my very limited memory of a bunch of helpful hot keys, shortcuts, and functions that I find useful in my professional and academic career.  It also taught me some new tricks that will definitely help to streamline my everyday job functions that require heavy Excel computations.  

This was an awesome course and I highly recommend for new, novice and even moderate users of MS Excel software.  For those advanced users, I still recommend it with the addition of their advanced Excel course.  I have not taken it, but if this course is any indication of whats in store - you will NOT be disappointed.

Kudos CFI!

                        It's very nice and well explained. The only problem is that I don't have a laptop for practice but the knowledge I have acquired through this tutorial is very powerful and enlightening. Thanks for free teaching spirit and my certificate will boost both my job hunting and personal motivation to delve deeper into financial analysis. Thanks again.

                        This course is very very very good but for me, the one time is not enough to listen, I need to take more time to make practical applications so you give me more time to understand

                        I wish I had taken this course earlier before I went for an interview. The excel review skills were very useful and truly refreshing. I have learned a lot from this course, more than I have in a lifetime working with Excel.
thanks

                        The Excel crash course is very helpful to brush up on different techniques for modelling.
I highly recommend to professionals working in financial analysis or data analysis.

                        This course was great! Of course I would think so since I am not a Excel super user. The best part was learning the short cuts. Some are a bit cumbersome but  well worth learning. During the course many light bulbs turned on for me and will make spreadsheets very workable for me in the future.  One down side for me  with the course is that I would have liked to see how Tim would teach v lookup and pivot tables. Tim has the ability to not stumble over his words, is a clear speaker and never tires no matter how many times I hit the rewind button. :) Great job! When I can afford it I would like to take more classes.

                        Overall outstanding. Only marginal criticisms were that I didn't know you would get the spreadsheet with the full answers at the end sop had to keep going back to check formula. Also the tutor was very clear, but a little fast at times over the detail. Working on an Apple Mac makes the use of Microsoft short cuts difficult but I got over it.

                        I found this crash course to be extremely helpful. I haven't used Excel that often, but I'm familiar with the basics and some formulas. The course found a good balance of simple, step-by-step instruction that is interesting for users of different skills. In some instances, I find using keyboard shortcuts a lot more cumbersome than a simple click, but I get what the instructor was trying to do...
Thanks a lot!

                        The teaching of the basics lesson is very nice and this will help us to understand each and every concept in detail. 

One suggestion from my side is to give the shortcut keys separately after the lessons so that it helps the basic learners to understand still more precisely.

Kindly look into it and keep up the good spirit.

                        It was very easy to follow every step of the course, good content, tips and formulas. It is presented in a simple but interesting way. I didn't feel bored or tired during any of the sections.  Teaches key advance Excel techniques that are very useful, for those who are developing a Corporate Finance career. I worked performing due diligence in the past 3 years and I wish I had done this course earlier. Highly recommended!

                        A great course, very simple and well taught. All free, I really enjoyed this. More interested to learn more just not fortunate enough to be able to afford it. 

I am a junior analyst and learning on the job and do not have access to funds in order to develop myself. The search for another video which is free to teach continues. 

Well done on the layout as well its really easy to follow and hard to forget. The lesson planner in this regard is very good.

                        This is a great course!  It's a very technical course, but, if one really wants to get started learning the latest in Excel financial modeling, this is the course to take.  And, it's Free!  I especially enjoyed the way Mr. Vipond presented the material.  He is a first-class instructor who knows how to explain and simplify the technical matters of Excel and the complex matters of finance.  I only wish CFI offered more Free courses!

                        This course is for Excel professionals who are familiar with Excel and shortcuts. The most impressive points are the professional format of the financial report and the shortcuts. You can get rid of the mouse after you can memorize and use the keyboard shortcuts you have learned from this course. Thank you CFI!

                        I've gone through many other websites, trying to find the easiest one. Then I found this one, it's perfect because the explanation is easy and you can clearly hear the voice of the man talking on the video in high resolution.

                        Guys, I believed I was pretty good at Excel, and I still do (I actually teach it - lol). However, your work with keyboard shortcuts only and introducing a bunch of data analysis very early in the game was awesome! I'm very impressed so far and look forward to the rest of your tutorials

                        This is the best and most concise course on Excel I have come across. For people in a finance profession, it is necessary to understand and learn excel spreadsheets thoroughly, which is an indispensable tool. I thank the team at CFI for having created this course. Thank you.

                        This course clearly and perfectly presents approach to financial model setup and analysis. During the course, a participant is led through best practices in model building and often hints how to do things easier in Excel. In my view, models built with these guidelines in mind will not only look more professional but also will be easier for others to follow and manage onwards.   
I will definitely take the opportunity to participate in other CFI courses as the material is presented in such an easy and digestive way that even those with very basic skills will immensely benefit from the training. I highly recommend Excel Crash Course - and I am sure that others will share my experience and take other courses as well.
